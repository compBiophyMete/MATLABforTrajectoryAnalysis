# MATLAB for Trajectory Analysis
The "SourceCode_MI" code was written in Matlab as a fulfillment of the Advanced Programming with MATLAB course offered at Istanbul Medipol University.

The code parses PDB and DCD files to measure pair-wise CÎ± atom distances of amino acids over the simulation time. If the standard deviation of the selected feature over the simulation is higher than the user-defined cut-off, then the normalized distribution of the measured distance is represented as a histogram.
