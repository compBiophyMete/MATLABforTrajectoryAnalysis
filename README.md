# MATLAB for Trajectory Analysis
The "SourceCode_MI" code was written in Matlab as a fulfillment of the Advanced Programming with MATLAB course offered at Istanbul Medipol University.

The code parses PDB and DCD files to measure pairwise Cα atom distances of amino acids over the simulation time. 

The code gives the following outputs:
1. pairwise Cα atom distances of crystal structures as a heatmap. 
2. if the standard deviation of the selected feature over the simulation is higher than the user-defined cut-off, then the normalized distribution of the measured distance as a histogram
